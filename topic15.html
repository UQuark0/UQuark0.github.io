        Internet security is a branch of computer security specifically related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network security on a more general level, as it applies to other applications or prierating systems as a whole. Its objective
        is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Intemet.The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information leading to a high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing., online viruses, irojans worms and
        more. Various methods have been used to prevent online attacks and enhance Internet security. Among the newly emerging methods is high level tracking of incoming risks. Some of the cyber-attacks arrive from sources already known to Intelligence,
        e.g., from belligerent nations, dark web servers, hackers, or arrive in conjunction with real terror threats. With the rise of extremist groups' online activity, including Muslim Jihadist activities, there has been growth in the number of eviler-terror
        attacks against western targets. In many cases there is a close link between terror and cyberterror threats, as more and more terrorists go beyond physical terror and harness cyberspace to compromise online and offline security of western targets.
        Many methods are used to protect the transfer of data, including encryption and from-the-ground-up engineering. The current focus is on prevention as much as on real time protection against well known and new threats.

        A computer user can be nicked or forced into downloading software onto a computer that is of malicious intent. Such software comes in many forms, such as viruses, Trojan horses sonvare, and worms. Main arc short for malicious software, is any software
        used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. Malware is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include software that
        causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency. The term badware is sometimes used, and applied to both true (malicious) malware and unintentionally harmful software. A botnet is knetwork of zombie computed that have been taken over by a robot
        or bot that performs large-scale malicious acts for the creator of the botnct. computer Viruses arc programs that can replicate their structures or effects by infecting other files or structures on a computer. The common use of a virus is to take
        over a computer to steal data. Computer worms are programs that can replicate themselves throughout a computer network, performing malicious tasks throughout. Bansoinwarc is a type of malware which restricts access to the computer system that
        it infects, and demands a ransom paid to the creator(s) of the malware in order for the restriction to be removed. Scarewarc is scam software with malicious payloads, usually of limited or no benefit, that are sold to consumers via certain unethical
        marketing practices. The selling approach uses social engineering to
