        British people have their own lifestyle and unique culture, but they are often associated with common stereotypes.
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>British people are tea lovers. They prefer to drink tea with milk. Tea is seen as a key part of British culture. Originally introduced as a luxury product in the 17th century, cheap imports from colonial India allowed its consumption to significantly
                increase during the second half of the 19th century. Though other hot drinks such as coffee are also very popular.</li>
            <li> British have their own accent of English with different slang and pronouncation.</li>
            <li> According to a popular stereotype, weather in the United Kingdom is often seen as being poor and rainy all the time. In reality, British weather is generally fairly mild but changeable. And people really like discussing it.</li>
            <li> Monolingual - There is a common stereotype that the British are only able to speak English. This stereotype has some level of truth to it as, like in many English-speaking countries, levels of bilingualism are relatively low. However, most
                British children receive at least a few years of compulsory lessons in foreign languages at school. In recent years, the teaching of foreign languages at an earlier age has been viewed as increasingly important.</li>
            <li> Drinking a lot of alcohol especially in Ireland where irish pubs were originated.</li>
            <li> British stand in queue a lot and there are many people who receive money for that work.</li>
            <li> Society has strong class system influenced by factors of wealth, occupation and education.</li>
            <li> Politeness - Both historically and in the present day, the British have often been associated with good manners by many people around the world.</li>
            <li> British love their traditions so there are still phone booths on streets that now can accept credit cards</li>
            <li> If u travelling to UK donâ€™t forget that people drive on the different side of the road here.</li>
        </ol>
