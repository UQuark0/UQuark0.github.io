        10 years ago today, Apple and iPhone changed our world
    </p>
    <p>
        Ten years ago today Apple <b><i>shipped</i></b> a wide-screen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone: and a <b><i>breakthrough</i></b> internet device. But it wasn't three products. It was one product. And we got it, Steve. We
        got iPhone. On June 28, 2007, Apple shipped the original iPhone. People had been waiting outside for days in --- <b><i>lineups</i></b> that ran for blocks. Anticipation was <b><i>off the charts</i></b>. Compctitors were nervously <b><i>dismissing</i></b>        it as a <b><i>over-reaching</i></b> and over-priced. Media was calling it the Jesus Phone. Steve Jobs had put sneaker to stage only six months earlier to introduce it. The most incredible (<b><i>keynote presentations</i></b> of his life—a life
        filled with incredible keynote presentations—and in the history of consumer electronics, he'd taken a moment before he started to <b><i>assemble</i></b> the team and tell them to remember the moment: The moment before iPhone. Because, in the next
        moment, everything would change. During the keynote Jobs said it was rare enough for a company to revolutionize even one product category. Apple had already revolutionized two: Computers with the Mac and personal music players with the iPod. With
        the iPhone they'd be going for three. He set up and knocked down the physical keyboard and the stylus. features that dominated the BlackBerry, Motorola. and Palm smartphones of the day. Then Jobs introduced the multitouch interface that let the
        iPhone smoothly <b><i>pinch-to-zoom</i></b> the physics-based interactivity that included <b><i>inertial scrolling</i></b> and <b><i>rubber banding</i></b>, and the <b><i>multitasking</i></b> that let him move <b><i>seamlessly</i></b> from music
        to call to web to email and back.
    </p>
    <p>
        They were technologies that would one day become <b><i>common place</i></b> across the industry but back then looked like <b><i>science-fiction</i></b>.

        Technology alone wasn't enough The original iPhone, based on the P2 device of the Project Experience Purple (PEP) team, code named M68 and device number iPhone1,1. had a 3.5-inch LCD screen at 320x480 and 163ppi. a quad-band 2G EDGE data radio, 802.11b.g
        Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.0 EDR, and a 2 megapixel camera. It was powered by an ARM-based 1176.1Z(F)-S processor and PowerVR MBX Lite 3D graphics chip. manufactured by Samsung, with an 1400 mAh battery. and had 128MB of on-board RAM. Two NAND Flash-based
        storage tiers were available at launch: 4GB or 8GB. More importantly. iPhone also included several sensors to enhance the experience. like an accelerometer that could automatically rotate the screen to match device orientation, a proximity sensor
        that could automatically turn off the screen when close to the face, and an ambient light sensor that could automatically adjust brightness. And it could also be charged—and critically, synced to iTunes—by the same 30-pin Dock connector as Apple's
        already exceedingly popular iPod.
